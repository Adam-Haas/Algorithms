Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Microsoft:  
  
You are given two linked-lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.  
  
Example:

Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)  
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8  
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.  

Have a great day!
